## PRACTICUM 6 - DEBUGGING EXERCISE<br>

### WHAT TO DO
- `Run the program.` Make any needed changes to the program so that the program

- `Test the program` and correct any logic errors.
- `Run the predefined tests` (click the Tests icon in the left column under Tools) and correct any remaining logic errors.
